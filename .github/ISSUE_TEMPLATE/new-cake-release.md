## Useful information

* [AppVeyor builds](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/cakebuild/cake)
* [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/actions)
* [Bitrise MacOS](https://app.bitrise.io/app/42eaef77e8db4a5c) / [Bitrise Debian](https://app.bitrise.io/app/ea0c6b3c61eb1e79)
* [Azure Pipelines](https://dev.azure.com/cake-build/Cake/_build)

## Repository Pre-requisites

### Automated Approach
- [ ] Run the [`Prereqs.ps1`](https://github.com/cake-build/processes/blob/master/cake/Prereqs.ps1) file, using the following as an example `.\Prereqs.ps1 -GithubUsername devlead` (use your own username). This will clone a new version of all required repositories.

## Let people know that things are happening...

- [ ] Please go to the General Channel in the Slack Team for Cake-Contrib and let people know that a release is away. Use a message similar to the following `@channel We will soon start preparing for the [x.x.x release](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/milestone/xx?closed=1) of Cake. So this is a friendly reminder to pin your Cake version! :pushpin: :cake:`
- [ ] Using the Cake Twitter account, tweet to let people know that the release is away to happen. Use something like the following `We are starting to prepare our next release, x.x.x (https://github.com/cake-build/cake/milestone/xx?closed=1).  This is your friendly reminder that if you haven't pinned to a specific version of Cake, you should do it now :-) üìå üç∞ https://cakebuild.net/docs/writing-builds/reproducible-builds/`
- [ ] Retweet the above from the cake-contrib Twitter account

## GitHub Issues Pre-requisites

- [ ] Make sure all issues within the milestone are tagged with either Bug, Feature, Improvement, Documentation, Breaking change, or Build
- [ ] Make sure all issues associated with the milestone are closed
- [ ] Make sure that all issues only have 1 label associated with them
- [ ] Raise an issue in the Cake.AddinDiscoverer repo **if there are any breaking changes** so the discoverer can be modified to generate a new markdown report and also an Excel report to track which addins are compatible with this new release of Cake.

## When doing a release

- [ ] Create a branch locally to match the name of the release, for example, `git checkout -b release/x.x.x develop`
- [ ] Update `ReleaseNotes.md` to include the next version number as a placeholder and save the file
- [ ] Create release notes on GitHub using the `ReleaseNotes` task (`.\build.ps1 --target=ReleaseNotes`)
- [ ] Update `ReleaseNotes.md` with generated content (making sure to keep the formatting the same)
- [ ] Build everything (`./build.ps1`) to make sure it works.
- [ ] Commit the changes to `ReleaseNotes.md` and `SolutionInfo.cs`. Use comment like `(build) Updated version and release notes`
- [ ] At this point, if you want to share the work to date, and validate something, push the local release branch to GitHub
- [ ] Assuming everything is ok, switch to `main` branch (`git checkout main`)
- [ ] Merge release branch to the `main` `git merge --no-ff release/x.x.x`
- [ ] Build everything (`./build.ps1`) to make sure it works (we can never be too sure).
- [ ] Push `main` branch.
- [ ] Make sure that all builds succeed before going any further.
    - [ ] [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/cakebuild/cake)
    - [ ] [Bitrise Ubuntu](https://app.bitrise.io/app/ea0c6b3c61eb1e79#/builds)
    - [ ] [Bitrise OSX](https://app.bitrise.io/app/42eaef77e8db4a5c#/builds)
- [ ] Assuming that everything went ok, go to the draft release in GitHub and click Edit
- [ ] Click the Publish Release button
- [ ] This will trigger another build in AppVeyor, but this time with a tag.
- [ ] Switch to `develop` branch `git checkout develop`
- [ ] Merge release branch into develop `git merge --no-ff release/x.x.x`
- [ ] Resolve any merge conflicts
- [ ] Bump the Cake Tool Version number in `.config\dotnet-tools.json` to the latest released version, i.e. the version you just released
- [ ] Build everything (`./build.ps1`) to make sure it works.
- [ ] Commit the changes to `.config\dotnet-tools.json`. Use commit message like `(build) Updated Cake Tool to version x.x.x`
- [ ] Push `develop` branch.
- [ ] Delete the local release branch that was created `git branch -d release/x.x.x` (and the remote one, if pushed to GitHub `git push origin --delete release/x.x.x`)
